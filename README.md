This is a fork to try to update the mod to 2.0 meant to remake LTN and support it to be able to get into the main branch aslong as it has approval of Optera. 

For now its a hobby project to see how I can update a mod and make it work for my own pyanadon game.
Not ready for space age if its 2.0 yet, since that supports multiple surfaces, and for now its a single surface mod. (could be simply fixed but not yet).

If no approval this mod will be a hobby project on my own to make it work for 2.0 as stated on the license, and will not be distributed.
